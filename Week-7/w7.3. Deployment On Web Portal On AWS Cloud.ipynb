    "To set up a continuous deployment pipeline from GitHub to AWS Elastic Beanstalk, you can follow these general steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Set Up Your Application on GitHub**:\n",
    "   - Create a GitHub repository for your Flask application if you haven't already.\n",
    "   - Push your Flask application code to the GitHub repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create an AWS Elastic Beanstalk Environment**:\n",
    "   - Go to the Elastic Beanstalk console in the AWS Management Console.\n",
    "   - Click on \"Create Application\" and follow the wizard to create a new application.\n",
    "   - Choose a platform (e.g., Python) and configuration options for your environment.\n",
    "   - Once the environment is created, note down the environment URL and other relevant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Set Up AWS CodePipeline**:\n",
    "   - Go to the AWS CodePipeline console.\n",
    "   - Click on \"Create pipeline\" and follow the wizard to create a new pipeline.\n",
    "   - Configure your pipeline as follows:\n",
    "     - Source: Choose GitHub as the source provider and connect your GitHub account. Select your repository and specify the branch to monitor.\n",
    "     - Build: Choose AWS CodeBuild as the build provider. Create a build project with the appropriate build specifications for your Flask application.\n",
    "     - Deploy: Choose AWS Elastic Beanstalk as the deploy provider. Select your application and environment created earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Configure AWS CodeBuild**:\n",
    "   - Set up a build project in AWS CodeBuild to build your Flask application. You can configure build settings, such as the build environment, build commands, and artifacts output.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Configure AWS Elastic Beanstalk**:\n",
    "   - Ensure that your Elastic Beanstalk environment is configured to receive deployments from AWS CodePipeline. You may need to adjust the IAM roles and permissions to allow CodePipeline to deploy to Elastic Beanstalk.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Test Your Pipeline**:\n",
    "   - Trigger the pipeline manually or push changes to your GitHub repository to trigger automatic pipeline execution.\n",
    "   - Monitor the pipeline execution in the AWS CodePipeline console and check the deployment status in the Elastic Beanstalk console.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Monitoring and Maintenance**:\n",
    "   - Set up monitoring and logging for your Elastic Beanstalk environment to track application health and performance.\n",
    "   - Regularly review and update your pipeline configuration and application code as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "By setting up a pipeline from GitHub to AWS Elastic Beanstalk using AWS CodePipeline, you can automate the deployment process and ensure that your Flask application is continuously deployed and updated with minimal manual intervention."
