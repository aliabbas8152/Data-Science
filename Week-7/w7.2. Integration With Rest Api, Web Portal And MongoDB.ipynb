    "This code is a Python Flask web application that serves as a web scraper for extracting product reviews from Flipkart and storing them in a MongoDB database. Let's break down the code step by step:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Import Statements**:\n",
    "    - `Flask`, `render_template`, `request`, and `jsonify` are imported from the Flask library for building the web application.\n",
    "    - `CORS` and `cross_origin` are imported from `flask_cors` to handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) headers.\n",
    "    - `requests` is imported to make HTTP requests.\n",
    "    - `BeautifulSoup` from `bs4` is used for web scraping.\n",
    "    - `urlopen` is imported from `urllib.request` to open URLs.\n",
    "    - `logging` is imported for logging errors and information.\n",
    "    - `MongoClient` is imported from `pymongo.mongo_client` to interact with MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Initializing Flask App**:\n",
    "    - An instance of the Flask class is created and stored in the variable `app`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Routes**:\n",
    "    - Two routes are defined: \n",
    "        - `'/'` for the homepage, which renders an HTML template.\n",
    "        - `'/review'` for handling the review extraction process. It accepts both GET and POST requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Homepage Route** (`homepage()` function):\n",
    "    - Renders the `index.html` template.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Review Extraction Route** (`index()` function):\n",
    "    - Handles both GET and POST requests.\n",
    "    - If a POST request is received:\n",
    "        - Extracts the search string from the form data.\n",
    "        - Constructs the URL for Flipkart search based on the search string.\n",
    "        - Retrieves the HTML content of the search results page using `requests`.\n",
    "        - Parses the HTML content using BeautifulSoup.\n",
    "        - Finds the product link from the search results and retrieves the product page.\n",
    "        - Parses the product page to extract review-related information such as customer name, rating, comment heading, and comment.\n",
    "        - Logs any errors encountered during the extraction process.\n",
    "        - Stores the extracted reviews in a MongoDB database.\n",
    "        - Renders the `result.html` template with the extracted reviews.\n",
    "    - If a GET request is received, renders the `index.html` template.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **MongoDB Integration**:\n",
    "    - The code connects to a MongoDB Atlas cluster using the provided URI.\n",
    "    - It inserts the extracted reviews into a collection named `Review_Scrapper_project` within the `Review_Scrapper` database.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Error Handling**:\n",
    "    - The code logs any exceptions that occur during the review extraction process.\n",
    "    - If an exception occurs, it returns the message \"something is wrong\".\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Running the Application**:\n",
    "    - If the script is executed directly (`__name__ == \"__main__\"`), the Flask application is run on the server `0.0.0.0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this Flask application provides a web interface for users to input a product name, scrape reviews from Flipkart, and store them in a MongoDB database."
