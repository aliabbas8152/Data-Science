    "\n",
    "Explanation: In Flask, the process of defining the URLs that map to specific functions or methods in your application is known as routing. When a user visits a URL in your application, Flask uses the routing rules to determine which function or method should handle the request and return the response.\n",

    "* app.add_route('/')\n",
    "* none of the above\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: In Flask, the @app.route() decorator is used to define a URL route. The first argument to the decorator is the URL pattern that you want to match, in this case '/'.\n",

    "* @app.route('/')\n",
    "* @app.route('/=default')\n",
    "* @app.route('/', defaults={'param': 'default'})\n",
    "* none of the above\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: To specify a URL parameter with a default value in Flask, you can use the \"defaults\" argument of the @app.route() decorator.
