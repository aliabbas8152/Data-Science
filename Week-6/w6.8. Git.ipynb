    "Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes in their code, collaborate with others, and manage different versions of a project. It is widely used in software development for source code management. Here's a brief overview of key Git concepts and commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Git Concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Repository (Repo):**\n",
    "   - A repository is a directory that contains your project and its entire history of changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Commit:**\n",
    "   - A commit represents a snapshot of your project at a specific point in time. It includes changes to one or more files.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Branch:**\n",
    "   - A branch is a separate line of development. It allows you to work on a feature or bug fix without affecting the main codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Merge:**\n",
    "   - Merging combines changes from different branches.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Remote:**\n",
    "   - A remote is a version of your repository that is hosted on the internet or another network. Common remotes include GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Clone:**\n",
    "   - Cloning a repository creates a local copy on your machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Git Commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize a Repository:**\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git init\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Clone a Repository:**\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git clone <repository-url>\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Check Status:**\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git status\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Stage Changes:**\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git add <filename>\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Commit Changes:**\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git commit -m \"Commit message\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **View Commit History:**\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git log\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Create a Branch:**\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git branch <branch-name>\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Switch Branch:**\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git checkout <branch-name>\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   (or use `git switch` in recent versions)\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Merge Branch:**\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git merge <branch-name>\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Pull Changes from Remote:**\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    git pull origin <branch-name>\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **Push Changes to Remote:**\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    git push origin <branch-name>\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **Resolve Conflicts:**\n",
    "    - Conflicts may occur when merging branches. Resolve conflicts manually and then commit the changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Clone a repository:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git clone <repository-url>\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create a new branch for a feature:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git branch feature-branch\n",
    "   git checkout feature-branch  # or git switch feature-branch\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Make changes, stage, and commit:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git add <filename>\n",
    "   git commit -m \"Implement feature\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Switch to the main branch and pull the latest changes:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git checkout main  # or git switch main\n",
    "   git pull origin main\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Merge the feature branch into the main branch:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git merge feature-branch\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Push changes to the remote repository:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git push origin main\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "These are basic Git commands to get you started. Git has many advanced features, and it's recommended to explore the documentation for more in-depth understanding and usage. Additionally, platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket provide a graphical interface and collaboration features that complement Git functionality."
