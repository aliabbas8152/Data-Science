    "Polymorphism in Python refers to the ability of different objects or data types to exhibit different behaviors or have different forms in response to the same function or method call.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of polymorphism:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Compile-time (Static) Polymorphism:\n",
    "\n",
    "* This type of polymorphism is also known as early binding or static binding.\n",
    "* It is achieved through method overloading or operator overloading.\n",
    "* Method overloading allows a class to define multiple methods with the same name but with different arguments or parameter types.\n",
    "* Operator overloading involves defining special methods in a class that allow it to respond to certain operators (e.g., +, -) in a custom way.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Run-time (Dynamic) Polymorphism:\n",
    "\n",
    "* This type of polymorphism is also known as late binding or dynamic binding.\n",
    "* It is achieved through method overriding.\n",
    "* Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its parent class. When you call the method on an instance of the subclass, the overridden method is executed.\n",
